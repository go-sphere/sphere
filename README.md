# Sphere

> This project is under active development. APIs may change at any time. Please use it with caution.

**Sphere** is a project template for building monolithic applications with a focus on simplicity, maintainability, and scalability. It uses `ent` for schema management and `proto` for API definitions, providing a solid foundation that can be adapted for microservices as your project evolves.

Sphere comes with powerful code generation tools to create `proto` files, `Swagger` documents, `TypeScript` clients, and
more, speeding up your development workflow.

## Quick Start

For a detailed walkthrough of setting up a new project, please see the [Quick Start Guide](docs/QUICK_START.md).


### API Definition Rules

For detailed guidelines on defining API interfaces, including HTTP transcoding rules, path mapping, and field binding, please refer to the [API Definition Rules](docs/API_DEFINITIONS.md) documentation.

### Error Handling

For guidelines on error handling and how to define errors in your API, please refer to the [Error Handling Documentation](docs/ERROR_HANDLING.md).


## Features
