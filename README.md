# Sphere

**Sphere** is a Protobuf-first Go service framework for definition-driven development. Start modular monolithic, scale to microservices. Define once, generate everything with rapid tooling.

Sphere comes with powerful code generation tools to create `proto` files, `Swagger` documents, `TypeScript` clients, and
more, speeding up your development workflow.

## Features

- **Protocol-First Design**

  Define once in Protobuf, generate everywhere. Get Go handlers, HTTP routing, client SDKs,
  and OpenAPI docs from a single source of truth.

- **Pragmatic Monolith Template**

  Start simple with Gin + Wire + Ent in a single binary. Clean architecture that scales
  from MVP to microservices when needed.
  
- **Complete Code Generation**

  Automated toolchain with protoc-gen-sphere ecosystem: server stubs, HTTP routing, field
  binding, typed errors, and validation.

- **Structured Error Handling**

  Define error enums in protobuf with automatic HTTP status mapping. Get consistent JSON
  responses with code, reason, and message.

- **Full-Stack Development**

  Generate Swagger documentation, TypeScript SDKs, and validation schemas. Bridge backend
  and frontend with type safety.

- **Developer Experience**
  
  sphere-cli for project scaffolding, Makefile workflows, and clean project structure. Focus
  on business logic, not boilerplate.
