# Quick Start Guide

This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough for creating, building, and running a new application using the Sphere framework.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
*   Go (version 1.24 or later)
*   Docker and Docker Compose
*   Node.js and npm (for TypeScript client generation)

### 1. Create a New Project

The first step is to install the `sphere-cli` and use it to bootstrap your new application. The CLI will create a new project directory with the recommended layout.

```bash
# Install the command-line tool
go install github.com/go-sphere/sphere-cli@latest

# Create a new project using the template
# Replace 'myproject' with your project name and update the Go module path
sphere-cli create --name myproject --mod github.com/TBXark/myproject
```

This command generates a new project with a clean structure. `sphere` is designed to be flexible, so feel free to modify the directory layout to suit your project's needs.

### 2. Define Database Schema with Ent

Sphere uses `ent` to manage the database schema. Define your database entities (tables) in the `/internal/pkg/database/ent/schema` directory.

For example, to create a `User` schema, you can create a file `internal/pkg/database/ent/schema/user.go`:

```go
package schema

import (
	"entgo.io/ent"
	"entgo.io/ent/schema/field"
)

// User holds the schema definition for the User entity.
type User struct {
	ent.Schema
}

// Fields of the User.
func (User) Fields() []ent.Field {
	return []ent.Field{
		field.String("name").
			Default("unknown"),
		field.Int("age").
			Positive(),
	}
}
```

For a detailed guide on writing `ent` schemas, refer to the [official ent documentation](https://entgo.io/docs/getting-started).

After defining your schemas, run the following `make` command:

```bash
# This command generates:
# - Ent client and schema code in /internal/pkg/database/ent
# - Corresponding Protobuf message definitions in /proto/entpb
make gen/db
```

### 3. Define API Interfaces with Protobuf

Your service's API endpoints are defined in `.proto` files located in the `/proto` directory. Sphere utilizes [gRPC-Gateway](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/) style annotations to define how gRPC services map to HTTP/JSON endpoints.

It's a good practice to define shared messages in the `proto/shared` directory. For example,
`proto/shared/v1/user.proto`:

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

package shared.v1;

option go_package = "myproject/api/shared/v1;sharedv1";

message User {
  int64 id = 1;
  string name = 2;
  int32 age = 3;
}
```

Then, you can define a `UserService` in `proto/api/v1/user.proto` that uses the shared `User` message:

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

package api.v1;

option go_package = "myproject/api/api/v1;apiv1";

import "google/api/annotations.proto";
import "shared/v1/user.proto";

message GetUserRequest {
  int64 id = 1;
}

service UserService {
  rpc GetUser(GetUserRequest) returns (shared.v1.User) {
    option (google.api.http) = {
      get: "/v1/users/{id}"
    };
  }
}
```

For more details on writing `.proto` files and using transcoding, see:
*   [Protobuf Language Guide (proto3)](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3)
*   [gRPC Transcoding](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/grpc/transcoding)
*   [API Definition Rules](API_DEFINITIONS.md) for Sphere-specific conventions.

Once your API is defined, generate the server code, client stubs, and Swagger/OpenAPI documentation:

```bash
# This command generates:
# - Go server stubs in the /api directory
# - Swagger/OpenAPI v2 specifications in the /swagger directory
make gen/docs
```

You can also generate a TypeScript client for your frontend application:
```bash
make gen/dts
```

### 4. Implement Business Logic

With the data models and API interfaces generated, you can now implement your application's business logic. In Sphere,
the business logic is typically placed directly within the `/internal/service` directory. The service layer implements
the gRPC service interfaces defined in your `.proto` files and uses the Data Access Object (DAO) to interact with the
database.

The `/internal/biz` directory is reserved for more complex business logic, such as background tasks or scenarios that
require decoupling from the service layer. For most CRUD operations, implementing the logic in the service layer is
sufficient.

Example of implementing the `GetUser` RPC in `internal/service/api/user.go`:

```go
package api

import (
	"context"

	apiv1 "myproject/api/api/v1"
	sharedv1 "myproject/api/shared/v1"
)

// GetUser implements the GetUser RPC.
func (s *Service) GetUser(ctx context.Context, req *apiv1.GetUserRequest) (*sharedv1.User, error) {
	// Directly use the DAO to query the database.
	user, err := s.db.User.Get(ctx, req.Id)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	// Use a render function to convert the ent model to a protobuf message.
	return s.render.User(user), nil
}
```

Note: You'll need to add a `render.User` function in `/internal/pkg/render/entity.go` to map the `ent.User` to
`sharedv1.User`.

### 5. Assemble and Run the Server

The application's main entry point is in the `cmd/app` directory. Sphere uses [Google Wire](https://github.com/google/wire) for dependency injection to wire together all the components (database, services, servers).

First, generate the dependency injection code:
```bash
make gen/wire
```

Finally, start the application server:
```bash
make run
```

Your server should now be running and accessible. You can also run the Swagger UI to explore and test your API:
```bash
make run/swag
```
