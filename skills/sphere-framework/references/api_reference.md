# API Reference Policy

This skill does not maintain a standalone API reference document in this file.

Use these sources instead:

1. `references/02-api-development.md` for protocol-first API workflow.
2. `references/99-quick-reference.md` for command and troubleshooting lookups.
3. Generated project artifacts (`swagger/`, generated `api/` code) as the source of truth for concrete APIs.

Only expand this file when a dedicated, stable API catalog is required.
